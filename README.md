This repository is just a collection of all the common Data Structure implementations using Java language.

Currently it includes following:

1) Dynamic Array Implementation using static array
2) Following Sorting Algorithms
 2.1) Selection Sort
 2.2) Insertion Sort 
 2.3) Bubble Sort
 Note: Above are In-place Sorting Algorithms with Time Complexity : O(n*n)
 2.4) Merge Sort - Extra space sorting algorithms - Time Complexity - O(n*logn)
-where n represents length of input array
