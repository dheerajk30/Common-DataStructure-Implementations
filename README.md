This repository is just a collection of all the common Data Structure implementations using Java language.

Currently it includes following:

1) Dynamic Array Implementation using static array
2) Following Sorting Algorithms
 2.1) Selection Sort
 2.2) Insertion Sort 
 Note: Above 2 are In-place Sorting Algorithsm with Time Complexity - O(n*n) where n represents length of input array
